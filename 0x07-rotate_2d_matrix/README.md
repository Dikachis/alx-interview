# Rotate 2D Matrix


## General Requirements
- Allowed editors: **vi**, **vim**, **emacs**
- All files was interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using ``python3`` (version 3.8.10)
- All files end with a new line

### Task
Given an **n x n** 2D matrix, rotate it 90 degrees clockwise.

- Prototype: **def rotate_2d_matrix(matrix):**

- Do not return anything. The matrix must be edited in-place.

- You can assume the matrix will have 2 dimensions and will not be empty.
